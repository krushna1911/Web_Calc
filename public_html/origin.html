            <p class="lead text-justify">In 1958, as a result of the Sputnik’s launch, coupled with the ever intensifying Cold War, the United States Department of Defense created the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA).  ARPA’s mission was simple.  Team up with the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration and regain United States’ technical superiority.  In order to achieve this mission, defense contractors, universities, and government agencies needed a communication method that could share mountains of data instantly across the United States and with our allies abroad.  The efforts and technologies developed to complete the mission became the physical foundation for the modern Internet.</p>

                        Many people think that the Internet was created during the Cold War as a way for the United States Government to protect computer data from a nuclear bomb. But this is not quite true.

                    Russia became the world leader in technology when they launched the satellite, Sputnik, on Oct 4, 1957. The United States Defense Department responded to Sputnik's launch by creating ARPA on Mar 1, 1958. The result was a four-month long study that led to the formation of the ARPANET. Without Sputnik, we might not have the Internet today.

                        <b>Leonard Kleinrock</b>, developer of the mathematical theory behind packet switching, has the unique distinction of having supervised the transmission of the first message between two computers. As a doctoral student at MIT in the early 1960s, Kleinrock extended the mathematical discipline of queuing theory to networks, providing a mathematical description of packet switching, in which a data stream is packetized by breaking it into a sequence of fixed-length segments (packets). It is very well explained in his paper: <u><a id="paper_link" href="https://www.lk.cs.ucla.edu/data/files/Kleinrock/Information%20Flow%20in%20Large%20Communication%20Nets.pdf">Information Flow in Large Communication Nets</a></u>.

                        <b>Paul Baran</b>, a researcher at RAND, offered a solution: design a more robust communications network using “redundancy” and “digital” technology. At the time, naysayers dismissed Baran's idea as unfeasible. But working with colleagues at RAND, Baran persisted. This effort would eventually become the foundation for the World Wide Web. Baran also developed the concept of dividing information into “message blocks” before sending them out across the network. Each block would be sent separately and rejoined into a whole when they were received at their destination.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify lead">A British man named <b>Donald Davies</b> independently devised a very similar system, but he called the message blocks “packets,” a term that was eventually adopted instead of Baran's message blocks. This method of “packet switching” is a rapid store-and-forward design. When a node receives a packet it stores it, determines the best route to its destination, and sends it to the next node on that path. If there was a problem with a node (or if it had been destroyed), packets would simply be routed around it.

In spirit, the concept was very much like the Internet of today.
