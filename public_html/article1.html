            <p class="text-justify lead">
                1.	To install pylint run <b><i>pip install pylint</i></b> in the terminal<br/>
                2.	To check current status of pylint<br/>
                <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" alt="article1" src="images/article1/img.png" /><br/>
                3.	To check version for installed pylint run pylint --version<br/>
                <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" alt="founder_1" src="images/article1/img_1.png" /><br/>
                4.	Now coming to the how to use the pylint, the best way to use pylint is to test individual file from the project.
                pylint filename<br/>
                <img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" alt="founder_1" src="images/article1/img_2.png" /><br/>
                This will rate your code on a scale of 10. If there are any error in the file it will list it down.

                <b>Factory:</b> Factory Method is <i>a Creational Design Pattern that allows an interface or a class to create an object, but lets subclasses decide which class or object to instantiate</i>. Here, objects are created without exposing the logic to the client, and for creating the new type of object, the client uses the same common interface.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
                <b>Instantiation:</b> Instantiating a class is creating a copy of the class which inherits all class variables and methods. Instantiating a class in Python is simple. To instantiate a class, we simply call the class as if it were a function, passing the arguments that the __init__ method defines. The return value will be the newly created object.<br/>

            </p>
            <div class="a1_code">

            <p class="text-justify lead">
                <b>Class and Objects:</b> A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.<br/>
                An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.

                In the above example, an object is created which is basically a dog named Rodger. This class only has two class attributes that tell us that Rodger is a dog and a mammal.

            <p class="text-justify lead">
                <b>namespace:</b> A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method. Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary. Let’s go through an example, a directory-file system structure in computers. Needless to say, that one can have multiple directories having a file with the same name inside every directory. But one can get directed to the file, one wishes, just by specifying the absolute path to the file.

                <b>Constructor:</b> Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.

Fixtures are used to feed some data to the tests such as database connections, URLs to test and some sort of input data. Therefore, instead of running the same code for every test, we can attach fixture function to the tests and it will run and return the data to the test before executing each test.
