               Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn (the duo said by many to be the Fathers of the Internet) publish "A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection," which details the design of TCP. TCP/IP became the standard Internet communications protocol that allow digital computer to communicate over long distances. The Internet is a packet-switched network, in which information is broken down into small packets, sent individually over many different routes at the same time, and then reassembled at the receiving end. TCP is the component that collects and reassembles the packets of data, while IP is responsible for making sure the packets are sent to the right destination. TCP/IP was developed in the 1970s and adopted as the protocol standard for ARPANET. During the development of TCP, Cerf and Kahn used the concepts of CYCLADES, a French packet switching network, designed and directed in 1973 by Louis Pouzin. It was developed to explore alternatives to the ARPANET.

                        Cerf worked at the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency <b>(DARPA)</b> from 1973 to 1982 and funded various groups to develop TCP/IP, packet radio (PRNET), packet satellite (SATNET) and packet security technology. These efforts were rooted in the needs of the military. In the late 1980s, Cerf moved to MCI where he helped develop the first commercial email system (MCI Mail) to be connected to the Internet.

He then helped develop the TCP/IP protocols for connecting diverse computer networks.
