The mainframe computers could not be connected directly to the network, there was a need of some sort of communication device known as “IMP’s” which would be equivalent to today’s router. BBN won the contract and went to build the IMPs for ARPANET on January 1st, 1969, and the first IMP was due at UCLA in 9 months. UCLA was also under a deadline to write the software so Sigma7 Computer could communicate with the IMP. </p>

                    Most people give <b>Ray Tomlinson</b> the title of email’s inventor. He came up with the idea while working for ARPANET, the government-funded research project that eventually became the internet. At the time, you could only leave messages for people using the same computer. Tomlinson created a program that gave users the ability to send messages between connected computers on the ARPANET system. Message was nothing more than a file, the file could be sent over the network. He put the two programs together, modified the code a little bit and thus the email program was born. He also gave the world the new icon for the information age, the <b>“@”</b> sign which was an obvious choice as it meant that there is <b>some user at some location</b>. The term email was coined several years later. The email became the killer app for ARPANET.

                    Internet was born from a research network called ARPANET i.e., a computer network funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. On its first day of office in 1969, ARPANET operated across 4 hosts. Each host had a unique address for online communication. The online addresses were identified using 8-bit numbers called the Network Control Protocol (NCP). ARPANET was thus, an 8-bit network. By 1981, it had evolved into a national network connecting 213 hosts across universities and research facilities. Soon, all kinds of networks emerged and so did the need to connect these heterogeneous networks into one big inclusive network. The idea was to maintain the heterogeneous nature of each network and also allow users to communicate across networks. To this end, the first half of the 1970s witnessed Robert Khan (DARPA) and Vint Cerf (NCP) work on a Transmission Control Program and publish their first paper in 1974. It was implemented through 4 versions, wherein the 3rd version segregated itself into Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). By 1978, the very first draft of TCP/IP v4 was published. By 1981 it became a standard and on 1st January 1983 i.e. “flag day”, ARPANET retired NCP and adopted TCP/IP.

                    <b>Paul Mockapetris</b> expanded the Internet beyond its academic origins by inventing the Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983. At USC’s Information Sciences Institute, Mockapetris recognized the problems with the early Internet (then ARPAnet)’s system of holding name to address translations in a single table on a single host (HOSTS.TXT). Instead, he proposed a distributed and dynamic naming system, essentially the DNS of today.

                <p class="text-justify lead">
                    Rather than simply looking up host names, DNS created easily identifiable names for IP addresses, making the Internet far more accessible for everyday use. After the formal creation of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1986, DNS became one of the original Internet Standards.

                    In 1985, NSF considered how it could provide greater access to the high-end computing resources at its recently established supercomputer centers. Because NSF intended the supercomputers to be shared by scientists and engineers around the country, any viable solution had to link many research universities to the centers. NSFNET went online in 1986 and connected the supercomputer centers at 56,000 bits per second—the speed of a typical computer modem today. In a short time, the network became congested and, by 1988, its links were upgraded to 1.5 megabits per second. A variety of regional research and education networks, supported in part by NSF, were connected to the NSFNET backbone, thus extending the Internet’s reach throughout the United States. Creation of NSFNET was an intellectual leap. It was the first large-scale implementation of Internet technologies in a complex environment of many independently operated networks. NSFNET forced the Internet community to iron out technical issues arising from the rapidly increasing number of computers and address many practical details of operations, management and conformance. Throughout its existence, NSFNET carried, at no cost to institutions, any U.S. research and education traffic that could reach it. At the same time, the number of Internet-connected computers grew from 2,000 in 1985 to more than 2 million in 1993. To handle the increasing data traffic, the NSFNET backbone became the first national 45-megabits-per-second Internet network in 1991.

                    Berners-Lee was a fellow at CERN, the research organization headquartered in Switzerland. Other research institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University had developed complex systems for internally sharing information, and Berners-Lee sought a means of connecting CERN’s system to others. He outlined a plan for such a network in 1989 and developed it over the following years. The computer he used, a NeXT desktop, became the world’s first internet server. Berners-Lee wrote and published the first web page, a simplistic outline of the World Wide Web project, in 1991.

                    CERN began sharing access with other institutions, and soon opened it up to the general public. In releasing the source code for the project to the public domain two years later, Berners-Lee essentially opened access to the project to anyone in the world, making it free and (relatively) easy to explore the nascent internet.
